Version 4004.0.5: release 2009-03-30; changes from 4004.0.4

 * Get serious about comments and Haddock documentation.
 * Cleaned up normalization of requests, fixing bugs and bringing together
   previous disparate attempts at handling this.
 * RequestMethod now supports custom verbs; use the (Custom String) constructor
 * Beef up Network.HTTP.Base's support for normalizing requests and URIs:
 
    * added splitRequestURI which divides a URI into two; the Authority portion
      (as a String) and the input URI sans the authority portion. Useful when
      wanting to split up a request's URI into its Host: and abs_path pieces.
    * added normalizeRequest :: Bool -> Request ty -> Request ty, which 
      fixes up a requests URI path and Host: info depending on whether it is
      destined for a proxy or not (controlled by the Bool.)
    * moved defaultRequest, defaultRequest_, libUA from Network.Browser
      to Network.HTTP.Base
    * added mkRequest :: RequestMethod -> URI -> Bool -> Request ty
      for constructing normalized&sane Request bases on top of which
      you can add custom headers, body payload etc.
